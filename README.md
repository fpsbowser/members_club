# members_club

members_club is an express app that utilizes EJS, MongoDB, and bcryptjs to allow users to make an account and post messages securely.

### Summary

This is a simple application that was created following [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-members-only) curriculum. The goal of this project was to continue to improve my knowledge and skills with Node, Express, Mongoose/MongoDB, EJS, and authentication/security with the Passport and BcryptJS library respectively. After I got all the functionality working as requested by the assignment, I decided to not spend too much time on the styling of this application so I can just continue through the curriculum. Maybe I'll come back to this application and style it to a point where I'm happy with it... who knows :)
